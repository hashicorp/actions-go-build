# Reproducible Build Action

**This repo is WIP; not ready for use yet.**

The aim of this action is to allow defining a build in such a way that we are able
to attempt to repeat that build and compare the results to ensure that we get the
same built artifact(s) each time.

More documentation to follow as implementation progresses.

This is for internal HashiCorp use only; Internal folks please refer to RFC ENGSRV-084 for more details.
