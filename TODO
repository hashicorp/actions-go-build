- Add GitHub Auth when downloading source for verification.
  - If GITHUB_TOKEN is set, always use it.
  - Add help text to error when auth is needed but not provided.
- Install needed Go version if not already present on system.
- Add a shim so that 'go' for the build is the correct go version.
- Move config package to pkg/


- Change CLI:
