- Default `product_name` to `repo_name`
- Automatically append `+ent` suffix for `-enteprise` products unless there's already
  any version metadata present.
- Fix broken tests.

### Development

- Added convenience script to set the current development version: `./dev/release/set_version`
- Added git pre-push hook to check that tests pass, all docs are up to date and more.
