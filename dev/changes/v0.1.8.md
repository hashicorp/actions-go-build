### Changed:

- **Dirty builds now fail early when running the action.**<br />
  In CI, there's no good use-case for dirty builds, however dirty builds still
  work locally when running the CLI directly.
- **You can now set `TARGET_DIR` when running the `build` subcommand of the CLI.**<br />
  This dictates the the output directory for the binary, as well as where to place
  other filed that need to be included in the release zip.
- **The `-clean` flag now produces a more useful error message when the worktree is dirty.**<br />
  It lists the paths which are flagged as dirty, to make it much easier to debug.

### Added:

- New inspect flag: `-worktree` which reports on the dirty/clean status of the worktree.
- Development documentation docs/development.md

### Fixed:

- No longer using the deprecated `::set-output` syntax in the action YAML.
