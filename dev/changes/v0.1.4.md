### Fixed

### Added
- New input `product_version_meta` for adding a metadata field to the product version.
- New input `work_dir` for setting the working directory.

### Changed
- The `product_version` input is now optional. Instead we should use a VERSION file
  in either the repo root, or .release/ or dev/.
- The `product_name` input's default is now the working directory name, unless
  the working directory is the repository root, in which case it still defaults
  to the repository name.
