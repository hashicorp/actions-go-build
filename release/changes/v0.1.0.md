### Fixed

- Uses the`-X` flag when zipping to exclude UID and GID info from the zip.
  This seems to make the zip file more likely to reproduce correctly.

### Improved

- Test cases now moved to their own reusable workflow which parameterises
  the runner. This means there are half as many test cases defined,
  and we just run the entire suite twice, once for linux and once for mac.
- Test cases are now ready to be run on our own self-hosted runners as well
  so we can exercise them in that environment.
- When there is a zip mismatch, we now dump detailed info about the zip file
  using `zipinfo` and we stat the product binary to aid with debugging.
- Logging now uses bold and coloured text to highlight major passages
  in the logs (bold blue) errors (bold red) and other important info
  (just bold).
